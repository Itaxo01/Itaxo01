### 🏆 Competitive Programming

I actively solve problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. This is where I sharpen my skills in:
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Theory (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
* Advanced Data Structures (Segment Trees, Sparse Tables, etc.)

Check out my `Competitive-Programming` repo for my solutions (Although they're not that organized)!

### 🚀 My Featured Projects

*(See my pinned repositories for the code!)*

* **[Professor Who]**: A Fullstack web application for rating and reviewing professors and courses from the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The application is fully integrated with the university site for the scrapping of professors and courses, along with student verification, only allowing access and use for authenticated students.
